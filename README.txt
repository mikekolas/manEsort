This is a python script I wrote in order to sort .jpg's in a manga-like way so you can print it this way.

1.)The scripts must be in the same folder that .jpg's are.
2.)I use the Image Downloader extension in Google Chrome in order to download the manga pages from the host sites.
   link for Image Downloader ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-downloader/cnpniohnfphhjihaiiggeabnkjhpaldj )
3.)The name of each .jpg I download has the form of "iii.jpg" where iii are numbers like 000, 001 etc...
4.)Because of #3 i made an optional script named ren.py that renames every file from format "iii.jpg" to "i.jpg".
   This means that a file with name 000.jpg will be named 0.jpg after running manEsort.py.
   The reason I did this is because it makes much easier the code in manEsort.py.
5.)When you do the above steps, it's time to print it. In printer settings you make each page have 2 pages and
   print on both sides.
6.) Good luck. Feel free to e-mail for any question about this script.
